# harry-potter-spell-book

For our group project we chose to do a Harry Potter spell book. We used two API's (Harry Potter and Responsive Voice) to complete this project. Our goal is to have you as user be able to access the spell of each character by searching their name in the search bar. We created a "Favorites" section where you can save the spells/characters you like as you come across them.
